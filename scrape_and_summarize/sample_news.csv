“The Iran-backed Houthi Terrorists have been decimated by the relentless strikes over the past two weeks. Many of their Fighters and Leaders are no longer with us. We hit them every day and night — Harder and harder. Their capabilities that threaten Shipping and the Region are rapidly being destroyed,” stated Trump.
He also said, “Our attacks will continue until they are no longer a threat to Freedom of Navigation. The choice for the Houthis is clear: Stop shooting at U.S. ships, and we will stop shooting at you. Otherwise, we have only just begun, and the real pain is yet to come, for both the Houthis and their sponsors in Iran.”

Trump's message was also reposted on the social media platform by US defence secretary Pete Hegseth and national security advisor Mike Waltz.
The Atlantic leaked messages from a confidential Signal group chat discussing strikes in Yemen, where top officials such as Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, Mike Waltz and vice president JD Vance mentioned timings for attacks on Houthi targets.
In one of the messages, defence secretary Pete Hegseth also spoke about the media strategy that would be employed surrounding the strikes on Yemen.
He said, “1. think messaging is going to be tough no matter what nobody knows who the Houthis are which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.”
He added that this was less about the Houthis and more about re-establishing a policy of deterrence unlike former President Biden, and restoring their freedom of navigation, after Houthis targeted US ships in the Red Sea. Details of the types of military aircraft, timings of attacks were also revealed though the Trump administration has denied that any of the information was sensitive.
""This case has been closed here at the White House as far as we are concerned,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, as quoted by AP.

2025-04-01,Sunita Williams on spending 286 days in space: 'I was a little excited…’,"Sunita Williams on Monday, in her first interview after landing back on Earth, said that she and fellow astronaut Butch Wilmore decided to make the best of the situation after finding out they would be stranded in space for an extended period of time, reported Fox News.
The human space flight mission aboard a Boeing Starliner craft, was revealed to have issues which could endanger Williams and Wilmore, who were supposed to return home after an eight day mission.

The prolonged stay at the ISS ended after a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule was sent to rescue them, along with two other astronauts, and landed back on Earth on March 19.
When asked about what her first reaction was to being stuck for an extended period of time at the ISS, Williams told Fox News, “My first thought was, we have to pivot. If this was the destiny, if our spacecraft was going to be going home based on decisions made here, and we are going to be up there till February, I thought, let's make the best of it.”
Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore also stated that while their mission was intended to be for a short duration, due to the uncertainty of space travel, they had planned and trained for spending additional time in space, if required.

“We jumped right into it, and did the tasks that were given to us. Deep inside I was a little excited because I love living in space. I loved seeing how the space station had changed since the last time I went there.”
She also detailed how she participated in various science experiments in space, and busied herself with helping out on the space station.
NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore, during an interview with Fox News, spoke about the larger purpose served by him and Sunita Williams in being part of a human space flight mission, and how he had reacted to news of their prolonged stay in space.

He said, “Honestly, it's not about me. It's not about my feelings. It's what this human space flight is about. It's our national goals. I had to wrap my head around, what does our nation need from me right now….we're an instrument of our nation and our national goals.”
Wilmore added, “Did I think about not being there for my daughter's high school year? Of course. But I compartmentalised. We have raised my daughters to be resilient, we as a family have talked about these things. Nothing is a given…we just focused on the mission.”
This was Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore's first interview after coming back to Earth. The duo also thanked US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk for facilitating their return home.

2025-04-01,Kunal Kamra reacts to Mumbai police's home visit: ‘Haven’t lived there for 10 years',"Hours after the police visited his residence in Mumbai, Comedian Kunal Kamra said he hadn't lived at that address for the last ten years.
“Going to an address where I haven’t lived for the last 10 Years is a waste of your time & public resources,” he posted on X.
Earlier today, a team of Mumbai Police visited Kunal Kamra's residence in Mumbai in connection with a case related to the controversial joke allegedly aimed at Maharashtra deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde.
Kunal Kamra, known for his satirical comedy, has been facing legal trouble following complaints accusing him of making derogatory comments during a stand-up show.
The Khar police have already sent two summons to Kunal Kamra since first registering a First Information Report (FIR) on March 24 based on Shiv Sena MLA Murji Patel’s complaint.

Besides the first FIR, three more cases have been filed against Kunal Kamra across Maharashtra. They were subsequently transferred to the Khar police as the venue of the stand-up show, The Habitat, falls under its jurisdiction.

The comedian, who lives in Tamil Nadu, has been granted interim protection from arrest by the Madras high court.
Shinde’s party leaders and workers had threatened to assault him if he was seen anywhere in public.
On his part, Kamra has refused to issue an apology for his comments and has criticised the vandalism of the venue where his comedy show was recorded.
“I will not apologise... I don't fear this mob & I will not be hiding under my bed, waiting for this to die down,” Kamra said.
The case stems from Kamra’s show at The Habitat comedy club in Khar, where he performed a parody song that also targeted Eknath Shinde.
Kamra’s parody song, set to a tune from the film Dil Toh Pagal Hai, featured the word “gaddar” (traitor), seemingly aimed at Shinde. The Shiv Sena (UBT) and its mouthpiece Saamana frequently use this term to describe Shinde and his faction, who broke away from Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership in June 2022.
The act prompted a backlash from supporters of Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena, who vandalised the club and the hotel in which it is located. Kamra was initially told to appear before police but he sought seven days’ time. Later, the Mumbai police told the comedian to appear before it on March 31.

2025-04-01,"Myanmar earthquake: Fearing tremors, patients prefer car park over hospital in Mandalay","Amid fear of aftershocks, hundreds of patients, including infants, the elderly and Buddhist monks, have been getting treatment at a hospital car park in Mandalay, the worst earthquake-hit city of Myanmar. Three days after the tremors that killed at least 2000 people, most commoners are preferring open spaces over their homes.
Mandalay General Hospital has around 1,000 beds; however, despite high heat and humidity, most patients are being treated outside in the wake of the massive earthquake, reported AFP.
After the 7.7-magnitude earthquake, several aftershocks rattled Mandalay.
""This is a very, very imperfect condition for everyone. We're trying to do what we can here,"" said a medic.
The situation is exacerbated by the sweltering heat in Mandalay. Temperatures soared to 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday.
Patients are sheltered under a thin tarpaulin rigged up to protect them from the fierce tropical sun. Relatives are trying to comfort the patients with bamboo fans.

Medics are also suffering due to long shifts and lack of facilities in the outdoor setting.
Although the hospital building itself has not been visibly affected, only a handful of patients who need intensive care, and the doctors who look after them, remain inside.

Fear of aftershocks is widespread across the city, with many people sleeping out in the streets since the quake, either unable to return home or too nervous to do so.
They have erected tents on the side of the road or are sleeping on blankets in the middle, trying to steer clear of the buildings.
The death toll from the earthquake in Myanmar has passed 2,000, state media said Monday.
Myanmar state MRTV reported that the leader of the military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, told Pakistan's prime minister during a call that 2,065 people were killed, with more than 3,900 injured and about 270 missing.

I'll always pray that you continue doing this great work, bringing not only education but also motivation to people. Also, keep spreading wisdom. People have a lot of knowledge these days, but they lack motivation. Your platform has been very helpful in that regard. I request you to keep up this good work”.

At this moment, Ranveer opens up about his meeting with him, referencing the recent challenges in his life.
Ranveer said, “We've met twice before in my life, sir, and you've always appeared at times when I was facing difficulties. When my reality is facing a tough situation...Today, I'm facing a huge challenge that I never thought I'd encounter, so I'm very grateful. Thank you, it was great meeting you”.

Some time back, Ranveer Allahbadia found himself in the middle of a massive controversy after appearing in an episode of India's Got Latent, which also featured Apoorva Mukhija and Ashish Chanchlani. On the show, Ranveer asked a contestant, ""Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once to make it stop forever?"" Though everyone present on the show laughed it off, the remark did not sit well with some politicians and social media users. It received backlash, followed by multiple FIRs against the makers and those present on the show.
Ranveer submitted a written apology to the NCW over his offensive remarks made on the show. Several FIRs were lodged against him, popularly known as BeerBiceps, for his comments on parents and sex. Though the Supreme Court granted him interim protection from arrest, it termed his remarks ""vulgar"" and said he had a ""dirty mind"" that shamed society. In an apology video on X, Ranveer admitted that his comment was not only inappropriate but also not funny.

2025-04-01,Elon Musk's Social Security numbers ‘mind-blowing’ chart raises eyebrows; ‘We found 20 million dead people…’,"Billionaires Elon Musk and Antonio Gracias have sparked new worries about the sharp increase in in Social Security Numbers issued to non-citizens. They displayed a “mind-blowing” chart during their presentation.
Ahead of Tuesday's Wisconsin Supreme Court election, Musk attended a town hall in Wisconsin to give two voters a $1 million check for submitting an online petition against activist justices. During his two-hour speech, he made a shocking assertion that non-citizens are receiving Social Security numbers.
Musk referred to bombshell inconsistencies in the Social Security database before welcoming Gracias to the podium. “We found 20 million dead people marked as alive in the Social Security system. This is so crazy,” he said.
Social Security numbers surge to 2.1 million in 2024Gracias, who has participated in the assessment of Social Security procedures, described how their research revealed an exponential rise in the number of SSNs granted to non-citizens. “In 2021, there were 270,000 issued,” he claimed, adding that “Now, in 2024, that number has skyrocketed to 2.1 million.” The two underlined that there was no political motivation behind their conclusions. “This isn't political,” said Gracias. He justified his statement by giving his own example. He said his relatives are foreign-born and he fully supports lawful immigration. “This is about America and its future,” he remarked. Gracias explained how SSNs can be issued to illegal immigrantsat the US border without stringent verification. “Once they're in the country and apply for a work permit, the Social Security Administration automatically mails them an SSN—no interview, no ID required.” Also Read: Elon Musk issues weird warning to Maxine Waters over shocking calls to ‘investigate and deport’ Melania Trump Musk rips into Biden administrationMusk took things a step further and accused the Biden administration of allowing the surge, stating that this was more than merely incompetence. “The Biden administration wasn't asleep at the switch. It was a large-scale effort to import as many illegals as possible, ultimately to reshape the U.S. voting system and make it a permanent one-party state.” According to Gracias, their team found non-citizens who were registered to vote and some of them even have already cast ballots. “We took a sample, checked voter registration records, and found people in this group had registered and voted. We've already referred some cases for prosecution.” Netizens reactWhile Trump claimed that his government would not alter Social Security payouts, the remarks infuriated social media users because Americans fear that Elon Musk's DOGE will reduce Social Security benefits because he publicly referred to them as a “Ponzi scam.” “You are gonna have to show the people the receipts on this. Otherwise it will just further divide people,” one X user said. “If there is evidence of this, it should be turned over to @FBIDirectorKash and @AGPamBondi to investigate and prosecute,” another added.

The duo discussed their hectic journey following their 286 days stay on the ISS owing to a problem with Boeing's spaceship.
Billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX capsules brought back Williams and Wilmore on Earth.
As the expedition was scheduled to last for just eight days, the two were questioned who was responsible for its failure. Wilmore blamed everyone, including himself. The duo, however, retaliated against claims that Boeing “failed” them.

In their first public interview with America's Newsroom on Fox News, Wilmore said, “There are many questions that as the commander of CFT (Crew Flight Test), I didn't ask, so I'm culpable, I'll admit that to the nation.”
He went on to say that he should have asked some questions, but he didn't. According to him, he was unaware that he needed to ask few questions. “But in hindsight, the signals, some of the signals were there.”
Commenting on whether NASA and Boeing are at fault, he said, “Everybody has a piece in this because it did not come off.”
There were various test-related and preparation-related issues that they were unaware of.
The two also discussed claims that they were “abandoned” or “stuck” in space.
“Okay, in certain respects, we were stuck. In certain respects, maybe we were stranded,” he remarked, adding that they did not arrive on the Earth as per the plan.
The astronaut quickly mentioned that they weren't stuck in the grand scheme of things because they were “prepared and trained.”
The pair declared they would love to return to space in spite of the problems. They further acknowledged that there were difficult moments, like the time Wilmore had to skip his daughter's graduation.
He even admitted to shedding a tear while speaking to his wife and daughters from the space.
The astronauts expressed gratitude to Musk and President Donald Trump for helping to ensure their safe return.
“Our situation, I think I mentioned before, maybe wasn't the perfect situation, but allowed a lot of people, including the President and Elon, to look at what's going on on the International Space Station, take it very seriously and understand that our involvement as a country, as a space-faring nation, is really important throughout the world.”

The left-arm pacer, who was feeling the debut pressure, made an instant impact by dismissing KKR skipper Ajinkya Rahane on the first ball of his IPL debut. The big wicket boosted his confidence and he ended up claiming a four-fer as KKR were bundled out for just 116.
Ashwani was right on the money and ran riot against the defending champions to dismantle their star-studded batting line-up by claiming the big wickets of Rahane, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell and Manish Pandey.
The 23-year-old pacer revealed that he ate only a banana for lunch because the pressure didn't make him feel hungry.
“I felt very good, there was pressure but the team environment helped me to settle down. I didn’t have lunch today, I only ate a banana, there was some pressure so I didn’t feel hungry,” Ashwani told broadcasters after KKR's innings.

2025-04-01,Boos replaced by cheers as Hardik Pandya receives rousing reception from Mumbai Indians fans at Wankhede Stadium,"Mumbai Indians got off to a rather sensational start against the Kolkata Knight Riders in their first match of the 2025 season of the IPL at the Wankhede Stadium after captain Hardik Pandya won the toss and chose to bowl. However, there was a bit of a highlight at the toss itself with Pandya being received with massive cheers at by the MI faithful at the iconic stadium.
This stands in stark contrast to the unsavoury scenes of last season, when Pandya was booed quite comprehensively by his home fans throughout the season. The anger from the fans came due to rumours swirling around the replacement of Rohit Sharma as captain by Pandya, who had returned to the franchise after two seasons away with the Gujarat Titans.
The toxic atmosphere at home had an effect on the field with MI finishing rock bottom of the table. Pandya also had a rather ordinary season. While he struck at 143.05, he could only score 216 runs in 14 matches. He also took 11 wickets but an economy of 10.75 throughout the season.
However, it all turned around almost the very next month as Pandya played an integral role in India's run to the 2024 T20 World Cup title, scoring 144 runs in six innings at a strike rate of 151.57 and taking 11 wickets as well. He and Jasprit Bumrah led the way in putting an almighty choke on South Africa in the final, with India winning it despite the Proteas needing just 30 runs to win off the last five overs.
The fact that the mood had changed in Mumbai could be seen back then itself, with Pandya being received with huge cheers during the victory parade in the city after the tournament and later at the Wankhede Stadium itself. It has now been confirmed and tied up with Pandya being cheered as MI captain in the team's first game at home in the 2025 season.

2025-04-01,Pataudi Trophy to be retired ahead of India's five-Test tour of England: Report,"The Pataudi Trophy, which is competed for in Test series between India and England at the latter's home, is reportedly set to be retired. Named after legendary former India captain Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, the trophy was first awarded in 2007, and India notably marked the occasion by winning a Test series in England for the first time in over two decades.
That remains the only occasion of India winning the trophy, though, with England winning the next three consecutive series. The last edition of the series was a draw and England retained the trophy. India are set to tour England for a five-match Test series starting on June 20 this year. According to Cricbuzz, the retirement of the trophy may come into effect before the series itself, with the possibility of it being replaced with a new trophy bearing the names of two other legendary former players from the country being open.
The reason for the retirement is as of yet unclear, with the report further stating that a source close to the family of Pataudi stating: ""Apparently trophies are retired after some time.""
Pataudi played 46 Tests for India between 1961 and 1975 in which he scored 2793 runs at an average of 34.91 with six centuries and 16 half-centuries. He played 40 of those Tests as India's captain, having taken over at the age of 21 just months after vision in his right eye was permanently impaired due to a car accident. India achieved their first overseas Test victory against New Zealand in 1967 under him. Pataudi overall played 310 first class matches, uncluding in England for Sussex.

2025-04-01,Heart conditions in women: Know the early warning signs to watch out for,"Heart diseases in women are at a disturbing rise and is one of the leading causes of death. However, the early symptoms are often misinterpreted and overlooked, making medical intervention delayed. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Bhushan Bari, consultant cardiologist, Ruby Hall Clinic said, “Women’s heart symptoms are often underdiagnosed or mistaken for less serious issues. Raising awareness, recognising the warning signs, and taking proactive steps toward heart health can make a crucial difference.” Also read | Your heart has its ‘own little brain’: Study discovers how heart surprisingly works like brain
The cardiologist further shared the key symptoms to watch out for.
Feeling unusually tired despite getting enough rest can signal an underlying heart problem. If everyday activities leave you feeling drained or exhausted without an obvious cause, it’s worth paying attention.
Experiencing shortness of breath after mild exertion or even while at rest can indicate a heart issue. Women often mistake this for anxiety or respiratory conditions, delaying crucial medical attention.
Though women can have typical chest pain, they are more likely to describe it as tightness, squeezing, or an uncomfortable sensation rather than sharp pain. This discomfort may be intermittent rather than continuous.
Heart-related pain isn’t always felt in the chest. Women may experience discomfort in the neck, jaw, upper back, or shoulders, which can be mistaken for muscle strain or stress.
Nausea, indigestion, or stomach discomfort:Many women misinterpret heart symptoms as digestive issues. Persistent nausea, vomiting, heartburn, or a heavy sensation in the stomach—especially if accompanied by other symptoms—should not be ignored.
